# DRL for POMDPs
In this project I'm using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to optimize **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP)**. 
The environment constitutes a flexible and scalable trick-taking game, which allows card games like *Spades*, *Oh Hell* and *Wizard* to be analyzed and optimized.
